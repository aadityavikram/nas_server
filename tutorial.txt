1. ssh-keygen on windows to create public key
2. Copy contents of public key (~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub or ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub) to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on Ubuntu
3. To edit a text file in terminal, use VIM
	a. sudo vim <path_of_file>
	b. Press I to enter edit mode
	c. Press escape to enter non-edit mode
	d. Press dd in non-edit mode to delete entire line
	e. In non-edit mode, press :wq to save and exit, :q! to exit without saving
4. To edit a text file in GUI, use Gedit
	a. gedit <path_of_file>
5. To read a text file in terminal, cat <path_of_file>
6. Now you can ssh to Ubuntu without entering password
7. To enter server from a device on same network, ssh <user>@<ip>
	Ex. ssh j@192.168.1.46
8. IP Address will change each time server restarts
9. To check current IP address, hostname -I. This command will give 2 IPs, one will be the local IPV4 address (required for SSH), other will be of docker image. Usually one with 192.168.x.x will be the correct IP
10. Run access_nas.bat file from Windows desktop
	a. This will create a server at address http://localhost:8888. Access the address in browser.
	b. It will point to /nas/storage/files. Can change this location in bat file
11. After closing NAS Server, find process running on port 8888 and kill it (see point 17)
12. Can also run server on Windows desktop with the following steps: -
	a. Open 1st terminal window then run, ssh <user>@<ip>, then run python3 /nas/storage/files/server.py
	b. Open 2nd terminal window then run, ssh -L 8888:localhost:8888 <user>@<ip>
	c. Go to browser and go to http://localhost:8888
	d. In this method, there is no need to kill the process
13. NAS folder path: /nas/storage
14. To transfer file from a device to server, scp <path_of_file_on_device> <user>@<ip>:/nas/storage
	Ex. scp .\Downloads\ABCD.txt j@192.168.1.46:/nas/storage
15. To transfer file from server to a device, scp <user>@<ip>:/nas/storage <path_of_file_on_device>
	Ex. scp j@192.168.1.46:/nas/storage .\Downloads\ABCD.txt
16. To transfer non-empty folders, add -r to commands
	Ex. scp -r .\Downloads j@192.168.1.46:/nas/storage
17. To exit server, run command exit
18. To find a process running on a port, for ex. 8888
	a. sudo netstat -tulnp | grep :8888
	b. Output should be like following
		tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:8888            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      15597/python3
	c. Here the process ID is 15597
	d. To kill a process, sudo kill -9 <process_id>
19. To check if Shinobi is running, pm2 status
20. To start Shinobi (if not running)
	a. cd /home/Shinobi
	b. npm install
	c. pm2 start camera.js
	d. pm2 save
21. To login to Shinobi on Ubuntu
	a. Go to browser
	b. Open http://localhost:8080/super
	c. Default username is admin@shinobi.video
	d. Default password is admin
	e. Create account that will manage cameras
	f. Go to browser and go to http://localhost:8080 to access cameras
	g. Shinobi requires MariaDB which is not supported in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS now
22. Shinobi installation instructions on Jetson Nano
	https://docs.shinobi.video/installation/jetson-nano
23. To access SSH server on Android (termux): -
	a. Install Termux from Play Store
	b. Run command, pkg install socat
	c. Open 1st terminal window then run, ssh <user>@<ip>, then run python3 /nas/storage/files/server.py
	d. Open 2nd terminal window then run, ssh -L 8888:localhost:8888 <user>@<ip>
	e. Open 3rd terminal window then run, socat TCP-LISTEN:8888,bind=<android_ip>,fork TCP:127.0.0.1:8888
	f. Go to browser and go to http://<android_ip>:8888
	g. To find Android IP, go to Settings > Connections > Wi-Fi Name > Scroll down to find IP Address
	h. Type exit to close open terminals
24. Simpler process to access server on all devices connected to same Wi-Fi
	a. Download /nas/storage/files/app.py to a system where server has to be accessed
	b. python app.py
	c. In browser, http://localhost:5000 then enter credentials and wait for localhost:8888 to be opened
	d. Find IPV4 of this device. If it is Windows, run ipconfig. Let it be device_ip
	e. On any other device on same Wi-Fi in browser, http://<device_ip>:8888
