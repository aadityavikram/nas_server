1. ssh-keygen on windows to create public key
2. Copy contents of public key (~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub or ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub) to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on Ubuntu
3. To edit a text file in terminal, use VIM
	a. sudo vim <path_of_file>
	b. Press I to enter edit mode
	c. Press escape to enter non-edit mode
	d. Press dd in non-edit mode to delete entire line
	e. In non-edit mode, press :wq to save and exit, :q! to exit without saving
4. To edit a text file in GUI, use Gedit
	a. gedit <path_of_file>
5. To read a text file in terminal, cat <path_of_file>
6. Now you can ssh to Ubuntu without entering password
7. To enter server from a device on same network, ssh <user>@<ip>
	Ex. ssh j@192.168.1.46
8. IP Address will change each time server restarts
9. To check current IP address, hostname -I. This command will give 2 IPs, one will be the local IPV4 address (required for SSH), other will be of docker image. Usually one with 192.168.x.x will be the correct IP
10. NAS folder path: /nas/storage
11. To transfer file from a device to server, scp <path_of_file_on_device> <user>@<ip>:/nas/storage
	Ex. scp .\Downloads\ABCD.txt j@192.168.1.46:/nas/storage
12. To transfer file from server to a device, scp <user>@<ip>:/nas/storage <path_of_file_on_device>
	Ex. scp j@192.168.1.46:/nas/storage .\Downloads\ABCD.txt
13. To transfer non-empty folders, add -r to commands
	Ex. scp -r .\Downloads j@192.168.1.46:/nas/storage
14. To exit server, run command exit
15. To find a process running on a port, for ex. 8888
	a. sudo netstat -tulnp | grep :8888
	b. Output should be like following
		tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:8888            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      15597/python3
	c. Here the process ID is 15597
	d. To kill a process, sudo kill -9 <process_id>
16. To check if Shinobi is running, pm2 status
17. To start Shinobi (if not running)
	a. cd /home/Shinobi
	b. npm install
	c. pm2 start camera.js
	d. pm2 save
18. To login to Shinobi on Ubuntu
	a. Go to browser
	b. Open http://localhost:8080/super
	c. Default username is admin@shinobi.video
	d. Default password is admin
	e. Create account that will manage cameras
	f. Go to browser and go to http://localhost:8080 to access cameras
	g. Shinobi requires MariaDB which is not supported in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS now
19. Shinobi installation instructions on Jetson Nano
	https://docs.shinobi.video/installation/jetson-nano
20. Process to access server on all devices connected to same Wi-Fi
	a. Run python3 /nas/storage/files/app.py in an Ubuntu terminal
	b. On 1st device, access http://<server_ip>:5000 and enter credentials
	c. It will redirect to http://<server_ip>:8888
	d. For rest of the devices, just visit http://<server_ip>:8888 in browser
	e. To logout click on Logout button. It will redirect to login page and kill the process on 8888
	f. app.py should always be running in an Ubuntu terminal
